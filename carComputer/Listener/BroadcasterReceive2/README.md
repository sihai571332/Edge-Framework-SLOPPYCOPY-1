This project relies on MULTICASTING to get data from one point to another. The multicasting code that establishes a
connection and listens for data is based on GITHUB user dmichael's MULTICASTING project at: https://github.com/dmichael/go-multicast

The code that takes the data received and writes it to a file belongs to Hiwen-STEM.
